# ledger.sh — append one line to a batch's thin ledger.
#
# The ledger records ONLY facts that gh/git cannot re-derive: team-lead decisions,
# verbal authorization, absorbed faults, gaps, pauses, and retrospectives.
# Stage progress stays out: recovery reads completed issue commits from the remote
# stage branch and restarts everything else.
#
# Why a script and not `echo '{...}' >> file`: a hand-built line breaks the moment a
# detail string contains a quote or newline, and a malformed line breaks recovery's
# replay. jq builds valid JSON every time, the timestamp is stamped deterministically,
# and the kind is validated so a typo can't silently drop an event from a recovery scan.
#
# USAGE
#   bash ledger.sh --repo-root <path> <batch-id> <kind> [--issue N] [--pr M] \
#                  [--scope-spec N | --scope-issues "1,2,3"] [--detail "free text"]
#
#   <batch-id>  Unique to one execution: spec-<N>-<UTC YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS>-<6 hex>
#               for a Spec, or an equivalent timestamped slug for explicit issues.
#   <kind>      one of: decision | authorization | fault | gap | shelve |
#               retrospective | closed
#
# LINE SCHEMA (one JSON object per line, appended to .afk/<batch-id>.jsonl)
#   {
#     "ts":     "<ISO8601 UTC>",   # stamped here, not by the caller
#     "kind":   "<kind>",
#     "issue":  <int> | null,      # the issue this event concerns, when applicable
#     "pr":     <int> | null,      # the PR this event concerns, when applicable
#     "scope":  {"spec": <int>} | {"issues": [<int>,...]} | null,
#                                  # the batch's initial scope in machine-readable form, so recovery
#                                  # rebuilds the batch-poll input deterministically instead of parsing
#                                  # free text. Set it on the first line (the plan decision/authorization):
#                                  # --scope-spec <N> for a Spec batch, --scope-issues <csv> for a slug batch
#                                  # (where batch-id alone cannot recover the issue set). null otherwise.
#     "detail": "<str>"            # human-readable specifics (the argument/decision/cause)
#   }
#
# LIFECYCLE (the skill drives this; the script only appends)
#   - First append happens when the user confirms the plan (the pre-authorization /
#     plan decision), which also creates .afk/ and the file. This first line MUST carry
#     the batch scope (--scope-spec / --scope-issues, enforced below) so recovery can
#     rebuild the members.
#   - Events append throughout the run.
#   - The batch ends with a `closed` line. The file is NOT deleted — it is the
#     retrospective/audit source, and recovery treats a `closed` line as the terminal
#     marker (a ledger without one is a candidate for resumption).
#   - A closed batch-id is terminal. A later execution uses a new batch-id. The one
#     exception is `decision`: the user may rule on escalated items after the closing
#     report, and that ruling belongs in this batch's ledger. "Closed" therefore means
#     "has a closed line anywhere", not "ends with one".
#
# NOTE: .afk/ is gitignored. This ledger is local operational state, never committed.
